CodeView is a free software which locates an identifier among files. Two editons are available for different uses: **Codeview original** and **Codeview with [hit-oslab](http://code.google.com/p/codeview/wiki/hit_oslab)**。

## CodeView provides ##

#### Lexical Analyzer ####

CodeView provides an analyzer, just like the Lexical Analyzer in compiler, to analyze all files in selected folder. It locates all idetifiers, stores and indexes them for retrieval.

#### GUI ####

When you type the identifier you want to search, a file list in which contains that identifier appears. Click one file in that list, you will see the file opened in an editor with cursor at the right position. What's more, files in the folder will be shown as a tree in the left part of GUI.

#### Lightweight code editor ####

An simple code editor is provided, which supports highlighting C/C++ source code, automatic indenting and formating.

## CodeView at present ##

At present, CodeView can only deal with identifiers in C/C++ source file. However, the source code analyzer is designed as modular and can be extended easily.

CodeView is developed using Qt-4.5.0 Open Source edition. So it supports **_windows_**, **_X11_** and **_Mac_**.
